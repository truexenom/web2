    <b>Goats and sheep don’t have teeth on their upper jaw.  They have a hard palate that helps them grind their food.
Goats are great companions for other farm animals, including horses, cows, and chickens.
Sheep make a bleating sound. A baby lamb can identify its mother by her bleat.
One mature ewe (female sheep) produces 7 to 10 pounds of newly shorn wool a year – enough to make a man’s suit.
Goats were the first animal to be domesticated, according to many historians.
The goat is among the cleanest of animals, and is a much more selective feeder than cows, sheep, pigs, chickens and even dogs. Goats do eat many different species of plants, but do not want to eat food that has been contaminated or that has been on the floor or the ground.
The chicken is the closest living relative to the T-Rex.
Some breeds of chickens can lay colored eggs. The Ameraucana and Araucana can lay eggs of green or blue.
Chickens have over 200 distinct noises they can make for communicating.
Pigs are considered the 4th most intelligent animal (after chimpanzees, dolphins, and elephants).
A group of pigs is called a “sounder.”
Cows can recognize their names (though they may not come when called!).
Cows have a memory of about three years.</b>
